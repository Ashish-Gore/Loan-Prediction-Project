# Loan-Prediction-Project

## PROBLEM AND OBJECTIVE

The SBA (Small Business Administration) helps small businesses by providing them guarantees for bank loans. If a company is unable to pay the loan to the bank, SBA covers the guaranteed amount and the rest of the loss is suffered by the bank. In order to determine if a loan is prone to being defaulted, exploratory and predictive data analysis can be effectively utilized. 
The SBA loan data provides various metrics such as the bank details and company details such as their size, location, type of loan and amount along with the duration of the loan. If the loan is defaulted, the date on which it has been checked off is specified. 

## Data Set Details:

The dataset is having 26 input variables where the dependent variable is to predict customer is a default or not.
